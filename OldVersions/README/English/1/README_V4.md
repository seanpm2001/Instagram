I only used Instagram for 1 day, playing with filters, then just completely abandoning it. I just applied some filters to my old YouTube channel logo, and somehow received over 100 followers for this. I didn't have much interest in the platform, and left after doing this.

## [Suspension (2023, August 11th)](#Suspension-2023-August-11th)

As part of my [:octocat: `Takeout Tuesdays`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Takeout_Tuesdays/) project, I went to do a data takeout of my Instagram account. This takeout was successful, and I kept 2 pinned tabs open for a few days afterwards. 4 days after the takeout, on 2023, Friday, August 11th, I was cleaning up tabs, and I found this:

| <img src="/Graphics/Suspension/Screenshot%202023-08-11%20at%2012-36-39%20Instagram.png" alt="Instagram suspension picture 1" width="480" height="253"> | <img src="/Graphics/Suspension/Screenshot%20from%202023-08-11%2012-36-18.png" alt="Instagram suspension picture 2" width="480" height="270"> |
|---|---|

I thought this was a joke, so I reloaded the page. It is official, they sent me an email too. The weird thing is, I did absolutely nothing wrong, I used the data takeout tool **that they developed, through the Instagram website itself!** if Instagram is a 3rd party tool, then Instagram itself is a violation of Instagrams Terms of Service.

Personally, I am happy with this. I have been wanting to completely remove my presence on Facebook platforms for a while now, and this account was completely dormant for over 5 years prior to this data takeout. Since I have a complete copy of the entire account, and that the account was suspended before I could go and delete it, Facebook has helped me get rid of my Instagram presence. My plan was to let it play out on its own, and unlike Twitter, this service has suspended my account within 5 days.

I don't want to be on a platform where users are valued this little. Facebook has harvested (and even sold) user data in much more illicit ways than any of its users (except for Google, and a few others) so they don't really have the right to say this without looking like a complete idiot. It appears that Facebook prefers bots over users, so this is fine. This only increases the percentage of Instagrams bot userbase.

I also faked my age. My DoB is already public, but I was not willing to directly give it to Facebook in this way. Almost everybody fakes it anyways, so it doesn't really matter what you enter. I entered 1970/01/01

<img src="/Graphics/Memes/Date-of-Birth/Giving-out-your-date-of-birth-online/PNG/HighCompression/Giving-out-your-DOB-Online_Meme_1200x1000_V1_HighCompression.png" alt="YesNo DoB" width="500" height="600">

I spent way too much time documenting this meme as well. If you want, you can read more about it [`here`](/Graphics/Memes/Date-of-Birth/Giving-out-your-date-of-birth-online/README.md) and also [`here`](Graphics/Memes/Date-of-Birth/Giving-out-your-date-of-birth-online/Project_Files/Resource_Files/Template/README.md).

This, however, isn't related to the ban, as they said nothing in the suspension notice about giving a fake date of birth. Even then, it would further confirm the illegal data harvesting they do on their users and non-users if this was stated.

About the appeal process, I updated this document twice yesterday, and both times forgot to mention this: I am not going to even attempt to appeal, as it simply isn't worth my time. Talking to a bot about what a bot said you did wrong is going to go nowhere. It isn't going to change its mind.

I am updating this file extensively, as I now plan to combat Facebook more publicly, and this is my staging ground for starting to do so.

I am still working on scrubbing the data of sensitive information, it may take months, it may take years (I am not spending that much time on this project) Data for my Instagram account will nonetheless be made public eventually. Once ready, it will be available [`here`](/Instagram/SeanWallaWalla/).

<!-- Notes 2023.08.12

I went and updated the file a second time today as well. I again (twice) forgot to mention the appeal process, but I already extensively said why I wasn‚Äôt going back on the platform. However, there was 1 detail I forgot to mention:

What may have caused the problem:

When it asked for my birth year, I gave them 1970, January 1st
