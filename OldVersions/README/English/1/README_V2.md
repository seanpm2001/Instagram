I only used Instagram for 1 day, playing with filters, then just completely abandoning it. I just applied some filters to my old YouTube channel logo, and somehow received over 100 followers for this. I didn't have much interest in the platform, and left after doing this.

## [Suspension (2023, August 11th)](#Suspension-2023-August-11th)

As part of my Takeout Tuesdays project, I went to do a data takeout of my Instagram account. This takeout was successful, and I kept 2 pinned tabs open for a few days afterwards. 4 days after the takeout, on 2023, Friday, August 11th, I was cleaning up tabs, and I found this:

| <img src="/Graphics/Suspension/Screenshot%202023-08-11%20at%2012-36-39%20Instagram.png" alt="Instagram suspension picture 1" width="480" height="253"> | <img src="/Graphics/Suspension/Screenshot%20from%202023-08-11%2012-36-18.png" alt="Instagram suspension picture 2" width="480" height="270"> |
|---|---|

I thought this was a joke, so I reloaded the page. It is official, they sent me an email too. The weird thing is, I did absolutely nothing wrong, I used the data takeout tool **that they developed, through the Instagram website itself!** if Instagram is a 3rd party tool, then Instagram itself is a violation of Instagrams Terms of Service.

Personally, I am happy with this. I have been wanting to completely remove my presence on Facebook platforms for a while now, and this account was completely dormant for over 5 years prior to this data takeout. Since I have a complete copy of the entire account, and that the account was suspended before I could go and delete it, Facebook has helped me get rid of my Instagram presence. My plan was to let it play out on its own, and unlike Twitter, this service has suspended my account within 5 days.
