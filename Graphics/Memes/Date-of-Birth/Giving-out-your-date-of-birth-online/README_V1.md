# Context

I created this meme on 2023, Saturday, August 12th to reflect a piece of context from an incident that happened yesterday (my dormant Instagram account being suspended) I forgot to write about my DoB life that I gave Facebook, and I felt a meme would properly represent it.

The meme pokes fun at the common fake DoB people give: 1969/04/20 (1969, April 20th) which reflects 2 overused jokes: 69, and 420; and the fake DoB I gave: 1970/01/01 (1970, January 1st) which is the start of the UNIX epoch.

My DoB is already public, but I was not willing to directly give it to Facebook in this way. Almost everybody fakes it anyways, so it doesn't really matter what you enter.

## GIMP

This image, like my others, was created with GIMP 2.10. There is no watermark, as it isn't necessary. I would have added "created wit GIMP" but almost all of my images are, so there isn't a point to do it exclusively here.

## Redistribution

I don't know why, but I feel I need to explain it here: this image does not have a watermark, and you are free to share, modify, and redistribute these files, as long as you don't take credit (basically, don't plagiarize, or do anything else unethical) the meme template is not mine, you don't have to give credit to me for using it (just give credit to the creators of Star Trek, or just don't claim you own Star Trek, unless you somehow do) but the meme itself is created by me. this is the same rule as all of my other works. I felt it should be mentioned here, as memes are more commonly shared than wallpapers in my case.
