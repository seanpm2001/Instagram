# Why this template?

I wanted a simple, 2 panel "no, yes" meme template for this joke, and I have heard of controversies surrounding the popular Drake (musician) version (something about sexual abuse allegations) and I didn't want to use it regardless, as it is so overused. This Star Trek version seems fine, but wasn't exactly what I am looking for. This is as close as I can get, I don't want to spend too much time on this.
